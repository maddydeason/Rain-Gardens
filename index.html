		<p><a href="http://www.goldentriangledc.com/" target="_blank">The Golden Triangle Business Improvement District</a> designed and constructed four new urban rain gardens at the corners of 19th and L Streets, N.W. this year.</p>
		<p>An urban rain garden is a planted depression that captures polluted rainwater runoff and prevents it from entering local waterways. The gardens are usually located near roads or sidewalks.</p>
		<p>The four new gardens total 2,280 square feet and are 10 feet by 57 feet each.</p>        
		<p>They have plants that can withstand both flooding and drought.  While the plants’ primary function is to filter pollution, they also support a habitat for bees, butterflies, and birds.</p>

		<p>Washington, like many other old cities, has a combined sewer system. This means that rainwater and sanitary waste run through the same pipe.</p>
		<p>On a regular day this system works fine.</p>
		<p>But when there are heavy rains, like during the thunderstorms that are common in the Washington Metropolitain Area, the pipe gets overwhelmed and discharges directly into the Anacostia River, said Lauren Linville, an environmental protection specialist for the District Department of the Environment.

		<p>The Golden Triangle project was mostly funded by a grant from the District Department of the Environment and the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
		<p>The District Department of the Environment, through the <a href="http://green.dc.gov/service/riversmart-communities" target="_blank">RiverSmart Communities program</a>, provides funding for the creation of rain gardens all over the city. </p>
		<p>Linville said that they are encouraging the development of raingardens because, "The more stormwater we can keep out of the system the less chance there is that the pipe will be overwhelmed."</p>

		<p>In addition to the four new rain gardens, the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District constructed another rain garden in the traffic island at the corner of Rhode Island and M Street, N.W. in 2012.</p>        
		<p>The garden filters tens of thousands of gallons of runoff annually, according to the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District.</p>
		<p>The Golden Triangle Business Improvement District is not the only organization building public rain gardens in Washington.</p>
		<p><a href="http://dcgreenworks.org/" target="_blank">DC Greenworks</a>, a non-profit organization that supports projects and provides information on storm water management and urban forestry, has constructed six rain gardens in the area.</p>
